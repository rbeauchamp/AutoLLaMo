# AutoLLaMo: Autonomous LLM AI Assistants, written in C#
An experimental open-source application that creates assistants, powered by LLMs such as GPT-4, to autonomously achieve your goals. By providing LLMs with a toolset with which to interact with the world, this project explores the full potential of autonimous AI.

## üôå Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) contributors for their work and inspiration. AutoLLaMo builds from their efforts and enables contributions from C# developers in this space. Please visit [their website](https://news.agpt.co/) to learn more and support their project.

## üåü Features

- üîÑ Expands its capabilities by generating its own Plugins
- üîå Extensibility with Plugins

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- [.NET 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. Set up your OpenAI [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

2. Clone this repository
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/rbeauchamp/AutoLLaMo.git
```

3. Configure your environment variables:
    - Locate the file named `.env.template` within the root `/AutoLLaMo` directory.
    - Duplicate this file and rename it as `.env` by removing the template extension.
    - Open the newly created `.env` file using a text editor.
    - Search for the line containing `OpenAIApiKey=`.
    - After the "=", input your unique OpenAI API Key (excluding any quotes or spaces).
    - Search for the line containing `OutputDirectory=`.
    - After the "=", input the directory where you would like AutoLLaMo to write files. For example `${USERPROFILE}\Documents\AutoLLaMoOutput`.
    - Save the `.env` file and close it. (Do not add this file to source control since it contains your secret keys.)

5. Open a terminal in the root `/AutoLLaMo` directory and build the image using Docker Compose

``` shell
docker-compose build autollamo
```

6. Run AutoLLaMo
``` shell
docker-compose run --rm autollamo
```

## üöß Limitations

1. Only a pre-alpha version, committed to GitHub recently. For example, there is no long or short term memory management yet and there are very few plugins.
2. Like Auto-GPT it may not perform well in complex, real-world business scenarios.
3. Quite expensive to run, so set and monitor your API key limits with OpenAI!
